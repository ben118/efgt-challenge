                                                Congratulations! You have made it to the Transition Phase of the Eat Fat, Get Thin plan. You
                                                might be wondering “So what now? What happens now that I’ve gotten the toxic, health­-robbing,
                                                waistline­-sabotaging foods and substances out of my system and replaced them with whole,
                                                real, fresh food and a healthy dose of good fats? Where do I go from here to continue my health
                                                and weight loss journey?”
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                Those are all excellent questions! First, we want to ask you some questions: How do you feel?
                                                What’s changed for you over the past 21 days? You are your own best judge of what works for
                                                your body. Dr. Hyman’s goals for this plan are to empower you with knowledge about fats and
                                                free you from “fat fear,” and provide the tools you need to be able to answer for yourself – now
                                                and forever – the question, “What should I eat to achieve (or maintain) my healthiest, happiest,
                                                and slimmest self?”
                                                </p>
                                                <h2 class="text-left">Step 1: Re­take Your Quizzes</h2>
                                                <p>The first thing that Dr. Hyman wants you to do is to re­take your FLC quiz. Based on your
                                                results, you can select a transition plan from the below options that works for you and your
                                                long­-term health goals.</p>

                                                want you to take a moment to check in with yourself and ask yourself “What are my goals
                                                moving forward on this program?”</p>
                                                <h2 class="text-left">Step 3: Choose Your Transition Plan</h2>
                                                <p>Dr. Hyman has kept it simple and created three plans for you. Check out these three plans

                                                        The transition to the Pegan Diet happens in two stages. First, you’ll follow a basic version, as a
                                                        way to keep the healing and weight loss going while reintroducing legumes (beans and lentils)
                                                        and ½ cup per day of non­-gluten grains. Ideally, we encourage you to stay on this portion of the
                                                        transition for at least three months.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        After three months, you can move on to the second stage, which allows for more flexibility.
                                                        During this second stage, there are options to test and add back in small amounts of gluten,
                                                        dairy, and treats. If, after testing, you determine you’re okay with gluten, dairy, and the
                                                        occasional treat, we encourage you to incorporate those options only sparingly, for all the
                                                        reasons you’ve learned throughout this program. In the Eat Fat, Get Thin Companion Guide, Dr.

                                                        include them in your diet, if you choose, in a balanced, smart way. This is indeed a diet meant
                                                        for life, as it allows for great flexibility and enjoyment of good food that supports your healthy
                                                        new lifestyle.

                                                        As you reintroduce beans or non­-gluten grains, it is important to notice how you feel. How is your digestion? Are you bloated? Are you tired? Are you gaining weight or still losing weight?
                                                        Do you have any other inflammatory symptoms? Your body is the best feedback mechanism. It
                                                        will tell you exactly what works and what doesn’t, what feels good and what doesn’t. If
                                                        reintroducing these foods doesn’t work for you, then stay off them for three months and try
                                                        again. Sometimes it takes a while to reset your body, and after a time you can broaden your diet
                                                        without side effects.

                                                    <p>
                                                        You’ve met your weight loss goals…your health is where you want it to be…you feel fabulous  and scored well on the FLC quiz. It’s time to become a lifelong Pegan! Stage 2 of the Pegan Diet is similar to the basic Pegan Diet but allows for more flexibility. It introduces gluten and dairy (to see if you can tolerate a little bit) and, if you wish, some treats.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>Here is the protocol for the lifelong Pegan Diet:</p> 
                                                    <ul>
                                                        <li>Avoid liquid sugar calories such as soda or juices (fresh green juices are fine).<li>
                                                        <li> Continue to eliminate all artificial sweeteners—now and forever!</li>
                                                        <li> Minimize all forms of sugar, but especially avoid foods with added sugars. You can
                                                        always add a little bit of sugar, maple syrup, or honey to the food you cook yourself. That
                                                        way you know exactly how much you are getting. Note that you should watch to see if
                                                        any sweetener (sugar, maple syrup, honey, etc.) triggers an addictive pattern of eating. If
                                                        so, you may have zero tolerance, and I’d encourage you to stay away from any type of
                                                        sugar or sweetener and get your “sugar” exclusively from whole fresh fruit.</li>
                                                        <li> Enjoy a little alcohol if you want (optional). One glass of wine or alcohol three to four
                                                        times a week can eventually be well tolerated by most people. Just pay attention and
                                                        notice how alcohol makes you feel. Avoid all other liquid sugar calories.</li>
                                                        <li> Continue to avoid processed foods.</li>
                                                        <li> Include as many non­-starchy vegetables as you want in all meals and snacks.
                                                        Remember, if half to three­-quarters of your plate is filled with non­-starchy vegetables,
                                                        you’re on the right track.</li>
                                                        <li> Include up to ½ cup of gluten­-free grains in their whole­kernel form: quinoa; black,
                                                        brown, or red rice; buckwheat.</li>
                                                        <li> Avoid all processed grains or flours (with the exception of the pasta you will use to test
                                                        gluten according to the instructions provided in the section following, “Reintroducing
                                                        Gluten and Dairy”).</li>
                                                        <li>Include 1/2 cup to 1 cup nutrient­-dense starchy vegetables such as sweet potatoes and
                                                        winter squash, up to two servings per day.</li>
                                                        <li>Include ½ to 1 cup of low­-glycemic fruit such as apples, pears, berries, pomegranate
                                                        seeds, watermelon, kiwi, lemon, lime, and pomegranate, one to two servings per day.</li>
                                                        <li>Include a moderate amount of beans and legumes, 1/2 to 1 cup cooked or canned, per
                                                        day</li>
