                                            It’s not uncommon for the body to have a strong reaction when you stop feeding it the processed foods and chemicals it is accustomed to, or when you get off inflammatory foods, or foods to which you are addicted.  As Dr. Hyman wrote about in his book, The Blood Sugar Solution 10-Day Detox Diet, most people are trapped by food addictions that have been chemically engineered by the food companies to keep us biologically hooked on their sugary, salty, processed “non-food.”
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            We’re cleaning out your system of these toxic foods and drinks, and just like any detox, that can cause some uncomfortable reactions like achy, flu-like feelings, irritability, nausea, headaches, and brain fog. The good news is that the discomfort usually passes within 48 hours.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Another culprit for feeling rundown or just generally crappy may be that you’re not getting enough salt. When you cut down on the sugar and unhealthy carbs, you dump fluid and water from your kidneys, along with salt. This causes a contraction of your blood volume and a general feeling of dizziness, weakness and generally feeling crappy. So be sure you are getting at least 1 to 2 teaspoons of sea salt daily in your food.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            If you have salt sensitive blood pressure or heart failure, be sure to monitor your blood pressure and symptoms.  If you use the E-Lyte at least 1 capful in 8 ounces of water twice a day it can have profound benefits of rehydration and replenishment. It tastes like salty water but it is so worth it for how it makes you feel. We use it all the time!

                                            First, and most obviously, be sure you are getting enough sleep each night. Poor quality sleep or not enough sleep will sabotage your efforts at weight loss and optimal health. It will alter your appetite signals making you crave carbs and sugar and will slow your metabolism.  If you are getting enough quality sleep and are still fatigued, it may be a signal that your body needs additional carbohydrates or protein (especially if you are exercising often or vigorously).
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            If you aren’t already eating a starchy carbohydrate like sweet potato or winter squash with dinner, consider adding that in now. You can also increase your protein intake throughout the day. Keep track in a journal of how you feel as you increase these to help you land on the optimal amount for your individual body.

                                            There could be a few reasons for this that may require further evaluation for hormonal, inflammatory, gut, toxin problems, genetics or more. To learn more about why you may have hit a plateau and how to address it check out Dr. Hyman’s free ebook Beyond Food: Other Causes of Obesity and Damaged Metabolism. You can download it at www.eatfatgetthin.com). But first, let’s start with the easy and often most common causes:
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Hidden gluten, dairy or sugar or sugar substitutes are slipping into your diet (or other potential allergens like soy or peanuts, or hidden additives, preservatives or other chemicals). I encourage you to read labels carefully and/or just cook at home for a while, to minimize exposure to these.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Carbs - your body may require more or less carbohydrates.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            For some people, a very low carbohydrate diet may not be optimal. If you are stuck and have hit a weight loss plateau, try adding in the starchy veggie at dinner, if you are not doing so already. If that doesn’t help you break through the plateau, then it may be useful to see a Functional Medicine doctor to evaluate other causes of weight loss resistance such as low thyroid function, adrenal dysfunction, intestinal bacterial overgrowth and leaky gut, overload of toxins, latent infections, mitochondrial dysfunction or more.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            For those who are very carbohydrate intolerant, you may need to cut way down on carbs in order to reset your body system. If you are diabetic or pre-diabetic, if you have high triglycerides or very low HDL, and if you have extra belly fat, then you are most likely very carbohydrate intolerant.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Cut out the starchy veggie at dinner and all fruit, and record how you feel (energy level, mental sharpness, digestive functioning, etc.) and your results over the next few days. You may need to experiment to get to the right level of carb intake, and the best way to do this is to track it closely.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Coffee (if you are drinking any) is having a negative effect on your system. Do a trial of going cold turkey on the coffee and continue on the program to see if this is the case.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Not adhering closely to the program. The meal recommendations, supplements and practices are all scientifically designed to work in tandem, which is why I encourage you to follow the program to the letter. Record your meals, exercise and sleep to make sure you are staying on track.
                                        </p>

                                            If you need extra support, seek out a health coach or a life coach. I recommend you work with the Handel Group (<a href="http://www.handelgroup.com/" target="_blank">www.handelgroup.coma</a>).

                                            Thyroid or stress hormones can be out of balance, requiring special care from a Functional Medicine doctor. Go to <a href="https://www.functionalmedicine.org/" target="_blank">www.functionalmedicine.org</a> to find a practitioner in your area.  You can also check out my ebook, The UltraThyroid Solution at www.eatfatgetthin.com.

                                            Toxic overload in the body. Heavy doses of environmental toxins and heavy metals can interfere with metabolism and weight loss, and may require a more comprehensive detoxification program. Again, seek out a Functional Medicine doctor for help with this by going to <a href="https://www.functionalmedicine.org/" target="_blank">www.functionalmedicine.org</a> to find one.
                                        </p>

                                            If none of the above helps you break through the plateau, then it may be useful to see a Functional Medicine doctor to evaluate other causes of weight loss resistance such as low thyroid function, adrenal dysfunction, intestinal bacterial overgrowth and leaky gut, overload of toxins, latent infections, mitochondrial dysfunction or more. You can always book an appointment with one of our team members at The UltraWellness Center in Lenox, Massachusetts or at the Cleveland Clinic Center for Functional Medicine in Cleveland, Ohio.

                                        <p>Kicking the caffeine to the curb is easier than you might think - if you follow the right protocol. </p>
                                        <p>Here’s how to make it as painless as possible:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Do it slowly. Reduce your caffeine intake by half on the first day, then by another half on the second day, and then down to zero.</li>
                                            <li>To reduce headaches, drink lots of water, do gentle exercise, and take 1,000 milligrams twice a day of buffered vitamin C</li>
                                            <li>If needed for headaches, try 400 milligrams of ibuprofen. I don’t believe in unnecessary suffering!</li>
                                            <li>If you’re tired, nap. Ideally you can quit caffeine on a weekend to allow yourself some extra rest as needed.</li>
