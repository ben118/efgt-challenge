                                            </p>

                                            <p>
                                                We have created the E​at Fat, Get Thin​staples shopping list (found in the Companion Guide in the resources section) to help you with this process. You will need these essential items for the entire 21­days of your program.
                                            </p>
                                            <p><strong>Supplements</strong></p>

                                                Though, you will be fueling your body with real food that is packed with vitamins and minerals. However, we all still need a foundational amount of nutrients to help our bodies’ burn calories efficiently, regulate appetite, cool inflammation, optimize your gut flora and help your cells become more insulin sensitive.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>That is why Dr. Hyman recommends the following basic supplements to optimize your body’s fat­burning and repair mechanisms.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>Dr. Hyman recommends the following:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>A high­quality multivitamin and multi­mineral supplement, daily as directed</li>
                                                <li>2 grams of purified fish oil (EPA/DHA), an anti­inflammatory, insulin­sensitizing,blood­sugar­balancing, heart­disease preventing, brain­boosting supplement, daily</li>
                                                <li> 2,000 units of vitamin D3, which helps insulin function, daily</li>
                                                <li> 300 to 400 milligrams of L­carnitine, which helps transport fat into your cells so you burn</li>
                                                fat more effectively and boost your metabolism, twice daily
                                                <li> 30 milligrams of coenzyme Q10, a critical nutrient for turning food into energy, twice daily</li>
                                                <li> 100 to 150 milligrams of magnesium glycinate, magnesium is a relaxation mineral that helps improve anxiety, sleep, and blood sugar control, and even cures muscle cramps, one capsule twice daily (NOTE: Check with your personal physician if you have any kidney issues before introducing magnesium as a supplement.)</li>
                                                <li> PGX (in powder or capsule form) — a super fiber that slows blood sugar and insulin spikes, as well as cuts cravings and promotes weight loss. Take 2 to 5 grams, just before every meal with a large glass of water. (NOTE: If you have night cravings or night eating tendencies, you can also take an additional dose after dinner.)
                                                <li> 10 to 20 billion CFU Probiotics, CFU stands for colony forming units, daily</li>
                                                <li> 1 to 2 tablespoons MCT Oil ­ a super fat derived from coconut oil that speeds up your metabolism and fuels your brain; add to a shake or salad, daily (NOTE: You can find out where to buy MCT Oil at www.EatFatGetThin.com/resources.)</li>
                                                <li>Electrolytes: E­Lyte (a liquid electrolyte solution), 1 to 2 capfuls, daily</li>
                                                <li>Potato starch: Add 1 to 2 tablespoons to 8 ounces of water, twice daily, to help balance your blood sugar and feed the good gut bugs, both of which help promote weight loss. We suggest Bob’s Red Mill Organic Potato Starch.</li>

                                            <p>If you haven’t already ordered your supplements, make sure to do this now so you can start day one with your supplementation.

                                                Now is the time to start thinking about scheduling exercise into your routine if you don’t already. The easier you make it for yourself to jump out the door and get moving, the more likely you are to do it regularly. Get your sneakers out of the closet, or go buy a new pair. Choose whatever clothing you’ll be most comfortable in for walking, and make sure it’s clean and accessible. By making sure you have the right attire ready, clean, and available, you’ll be set to lace up and exercise on day one.

                                            <h2 class="text-left">Step 4: Take Your Measurements</h2>
                                            <p>
                                                Studies show you will achieve up to 50 percent more success if you keep track of your progress. Take the following measurements the day before you start the program and record them in your journal PDF. You can access your journal questions and measurements in the resources section.  
                                            </p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Your weight ­ weigh yourself first thing in the morning without clothes and after going to the bathroom</li>
                                                <li>Your height ­ measure your height in feet and inches</li>
                                                <li>Your waist size ­ using a tape measure, find the widest point at your belly button, not
                                                where your belt falls</li>
                                                <li>Your hip size ­ using a tape measure, find the widest point around your hips.</li>
                                                <li>Your thigh circumference – using a tape measure, find the widest point around each
                                                thigh</li>
                                                <li>Your blood pressure ­ this can be done by your doctor, at the drugstore, or at home if
                                                you purchase a basic home blood pressure cuff</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <h2 class="text-left">Step 5: Get Tested by Your Doctor (optional)</h2>
                                            <p>The quizzes you take in Step 1 will give you a good overall sense of your health. However, there is a set of laboratory tests that I strongly encourage you to take that shows you what’s really going on. There are two levels of testing needed to properly assess diabesity and food addiction, its complications, and its causes. Take the tests before your detox and again after you have been on the Transition Phase for three months. By taking these tests, you will see how much the changes you’re making can transform your health.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                Dr. Hyman created a very helpful e­book called​H​ow To Work With Your Doctor To Get What You Need​that you will find helpful during this testing process. You can access this e­book in the resources tab.
                                            </p>  
                                            <p>The tests he recommends include:</p> 
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Insulin response test, which is like a two­hour glucose tolerance test but this one also measures insulin as well. It is done in three parts: first we measure your insulin and glucose first thing after fasting overnight. Then you consume a drink containing 75 grams of glucose. Then your insulin and glucose levels are again measured after one­ and two­hour intervals. This test is the best way to tell how your body processes glucose and produces insulin.</li>
                                                <li>Hemoglobin A1c measures your average blood sugar over the past six weeks. Anything 5.5 percent or above is considered elevated; over 6.0 percent is means you have diabetes.</li>
                                                <li>NMR lipid (cholesterol) profile or ,Cardio IQ Lipoprotein Fractionation test, which measures LDL, HDL, and triglycerides, and the particle number and particle size of each type of cholesterol and triglycerides. (This is a newer test, but I would demand it from your doctor, because the typical cholesterol tests done by most labs and doctors are out of date.) This test can only be obtained through LabCorp, Quest or LipoScience. You can find a link to these sites at​ 
                                                <br/><a href="http://www.eatfatgetthin.com/resources.html" target="_blank">w​ww.EatFatGetThin.com/resources</a>.​</li>
                                                <li>Total cholesterol – ideally under 200 mg/dl but this matters less than the overall profile. If your total cholesterol is 300 mg/dl and your HDL is 100 mg/dl, then that is much better than a total cholesterol of 150 mg/dl and an HDL of 30 mg/dl.</li>
                                                <li>LDL cholesterol – ideally under 100 mg/dl but more important is the total particle number which should be less than 1000 and the small LDL particle number which should be less than 400 (or even lower)</li>
                                                <li>HDL cholesterol – ideally over 50 mg/dl for men and over 60 mg/dl for women</li>
                                                <li>Triglycerides – okay if under 100 mg/dl; ideal if under 70 mg/dl</li>
                                                <li>Triglycerides to HDL ration ­ ideally less than 1:1 or 2:1</li>
                                                <li>Total cholesterol to HDL ratio ­ ideally less than 3:1</li>
                                            </ul>

                                                Losing weight and getting healthy is a social activity! You certainly c​an d​o the program alone, but if you find a buddy, join or create a group, or join​o​ur <a href="http://drhyman.com/programs/eat-fat-get-thin/community">online community</a>,​you will not only find support for your journey but also friends to help when you have questions or feel discouraged – and you will likely achieve twice the results as when you go it alone.
